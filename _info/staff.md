Office Hours 
Eventually, there will be a variety of opportunities for in-person office hours throughout the week.  We have to get keys distributed first, though, and set up assignments to timeslots.

Office hours for the weeks of 09/23-09/25, and 09/26-10/02 will be online at <https://bit.ly/cs16-f21-office-hours> per the schedule below.

## Course instructor: Phill Conrad

* Email: Please use Campuswire rather than email for course related communication.  You can send private messages on Campuswire to either the entire course staff or directly to me. If you must email me using my email address (phtcon@ucsb.edu), please put `CS16` in the subject line, and know that there may be a delay in the response. 
 

## Course TAs

## Learning Assistants (LAs)
In addition to the instructor and TA, there will be some undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) in the course who are available to assist you during your scheduled lab sections (also called closed labs) and by holding additional help hours outside of sections (also called open-labs). The closed-labs are only available to students registered for that lab section on GOLD. The open-labs are available to all students registered in the course (similar to office hours). 

## Learning Assistants in training (LAs in training)

There may also be a few LAs in training, students in course numbered CMPSC 100.  These students will be shadowing the instructor, TAs, and LAs during the first five weeks of the course to learn about teaching CS.  During the first five weeks of the course, they are not permitted to help (it is a union violation), only observe.  Please make them welcome, and respect their boundaries.  Starting in week 6, they will start getting paid, and will start helping with the course.

I also did my undergrad here at UCSB, so if you have any questions about specific classes or my undergrad experience in general, feel free to reach out or swing by office hours. If you ever have any questions, the best way to contact me will be through Campuswire through DM, and I'll try to get back to you within 24 hours.

Hello dear students! My name is Arthur, and I will be your ULA this quarter. CS16 was the first course I took at UCSB three years ago, so I'm nostalgic and also exteremely sympathetic towards you who get to experience this course and learn the basics of C++ for the first time. I will do my best to make sure you have a good experience in this class. Feel free to come for any help or chat about anything that interests you.
